# No YouTube AI Summary

A very simple FireFox extension that hides all AI summaries on the YouTube watch page. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

I really don't know what else to say here.

I made it since there didn't seem to be any public extensions that did this and I personally hate the Gemini summaries as they provide very shallow summaries that don't contain any useful information and commonly misunderstands the points of videos. If you click on a video, chances are it's because you want to watch it, not read a phoned-in summary.
